2️⃣ Project Name - data_cleaning  
Tools Used: SQL, Python  

* Cleaned and transformed the `nashville_housing` dataset to improve data consistency.  
* Converted data types, standardized values, and populated missing address fields.
* Split address-related columns (`PropertyAddress`) into separate fields.
* Replaced categorical values (e.g., "Y"/"N" → "Yes"/"No") for better readability.
* Removed duplicate records using `ROW_NUMBER()` and deleted unused columns.
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights.🚀

3️⃣ Project Name - Movies Correlation 
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  

- Imported and processed movie dataset using libraries like Pandas and NumPy.  
- Converted column data types (e.g., changing object types to numeric for analysis).  
- Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy.  
- Created scatter plots to visualize relationships between key variables (e.g., budget vs. revenue).  
- Analyzed trends to understand patterns in movie performance.  
- Built a correlation table using a heatmap to identify strong relationships between features.  
- Derived insights on factors influencing movie success using data visualization. 🚀
